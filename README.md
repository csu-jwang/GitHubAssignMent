Adding this readme file as per assignment requirements

While the readme is helpful I would've liked to see maybe a walkthrough
on how to integrate this github walkthrough with an IDE
so we can see how to link the github account to our local repo
and push/pull code through our IDE instead of going through 
the web browswer and manually adding in the file
